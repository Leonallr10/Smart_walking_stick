# Smart Blind Stick: IoT and AI-Powered Assistive Device

## Problem Statement
Visually impaired persons do not move independently safely. The conventional white canes do not detect obstacles or objects; thus, cannot be used in giving GPS tracking for safety assurance of the person involved or the provision of real-time help in navigating.

## Existing Work
- **IoT-Based Smart Stick for the Blind (Varsha Vimal Soo)**
- **B09010914-libre.pdf Project**
- **IoT-Based Smart Blind Stick (SpringerLink)**

### Common Features
- Obstacle detection
- Water sensing
- GPS tracking
- GSM communication

## Unique Ideas in Our Project

### Object Detection using ESP32-CAM and AI
This feeds the senses of vision for environmental awareness by an identification of objects. Using a specific camera board like ESP32-CAM for this purpose is particularly novel in the design of smart sticks.

### Button to share live location with a neighbor
Use of a GPS module to share live location when the button is pressed by the user. This functionality enables one to call or send their location in case of an emergency directly.

### Advanced navigation with Gemini API
AI-assisted route planning and navigation. The Gemini API approach is distinct and is, therefore, not highly mentioned in the previous texts.

### Bluetooth headphone integration
Audio feedback is private and clear. Audio feedback is widespread, but having the Bluetooth headphones as a tool of privacy for self-listening is a good attention.

### Dual-board architecture (Raspberry Pi 5 + ESP32)
Efficient task assignment and power consumption. The design supports more intensive computation as it likely prolongs battery life.

### Edge computing capability
On-device AI processing decreases reliance on internet connectivity. This can improve response times and helps protect private data from internet connectivity-dependent solutions.

### Implementation of RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)
To schedule tasks in the most efficient possible way. This will make the entire system better performing and more reliable.

### Lets enable the guard to envision where the blind person is using a mobile app
This helps safety features about the device coupled with keeping the caregivers updated.
